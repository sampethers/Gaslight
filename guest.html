I try not to talk about the Tim Rogers thing anymore.<br><br><b>Do people still bring it up?</b> Yeah, all the time. That’s my claim to fame apparently.<br><br><b>So you’re in Sydney?</b> I’m in the Blue Mountains.<br><br><b>Do you live up there?</b><br>Yeah.<br><br><b>How long have you been there?</b><br>Just a few months.<br><br><b>What prompted the move?</b><br>I was living in Kings Cross and getting a bit silly. It’s a self-imposed exile … I’m on the internet now doing promo stuff now. It’s a really beautiful place where we are. The autumn is much more intense than it is in Sydney.<br><br><b>Hurtsville is an incredibly different record to Love Is Gone, obviously. Just wondering how you arrived at this sound?</b><br><br>I guess it was a long process of trial and error. I’ve never been big on guitars. I like guitars. I play acoustic guitar, but when I played electric guitar I wanted the sound to be very pure, without effect. When we did Love Is Gone, I was very anti effects pedals. I didn’t even want reverb on my voice. I was afraid of that process and wanted to keep it as raw and natural sounding as possible. I don’t know what happened, but we made that record [Love Is Gone] and then I went away. People thought I made Love Is Gone in New York when I went over there, but I actually made it before. It was a reaction to a record I was making before that was really dense and orchestral and dark and moody, and I just decided I didn’t want that: I wanted to make a rock’n’roll record.<br>So what happened was I made that record [Love Is Gone], went away [to New York] for nine months and then came back. I started playing it but was bored by it already. I needed to get another guitar player to flesh it out, because it was just like a trio. I should’ve got a keyboard player and horns to do the record probably, but instead I met Kirin. He was opening a show for me – my manager booked him, because he was a friend and he thought I’d like him – we got along pretty well and I asked him to be in the band with me. The songs were so simple, I thought I could do them any old way and they’d still be the same songs. They’re very basic chords and the lyrical content is strong. It’s more in the phrasing than it is in the melody, so I could do whatever I wanted with the song.<br>Kirin’s much more intuitive – he doesn’t know written music – so I was very open to him doing what he does, letting him work with Lawrence [Pike] and the other guys. Then we would take the song in a certain direction. All the songs changed so dramatically that when we went on tour no one really recognised a lot of the record.<br><br><b>Which is where it’s at now.</b><br>Which is where it’s at now.<br><br><b>I guess people who didn’t know that back story would assume it wasn’t a natural progression.</b><br>It’s really natural and it’s very incremental; step-by-step to reach where it is. Because three years passes in an album cycle now, ideally I should’ve been documenting each step of the way. I’d like to release the live recording of Love Is Gone with this record, because I want people to see it as a step, rather than a shocking jump.<br><br><b>Well, you’ve gone straight from a sort of Motown-sounding record to a weird Australian gothic album.</b><br>Yeah, but people always thought that’s what I did anyway. The Nick Cave thing always gets brought up. People say the last record sounded like Nick Cave – it sounds absolutely nothing like Nick Cave. I don’t know why that happens. It’s not even just journalists, it’s kids that come to the shows, “Oh, it sounds like Nick Cave.” And you’re just like, “Well, it does and it doesn’t.”<br><br><b>I think it’s because you have a deep voice, maybe?</b><br>It’s a very superficial thing.<br><br><b>There is that Australian gothic element, but that encompasses The Triffids and Rowland S Howard, and others as well.</b><br>I got heavily influenced by the Triffids somewhere along the line. I got In The Pines first. That was the inroad. That ’80s Australian sound was never really something I enjoyed growing up. It came to me really late.</p><iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dGVFuGlqwdk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Writing a description of this album is no small task, its like trying to describe an epic road trip to a friend that stayed at home- you just have to live it. You have definitely heard one track from the ten listed above, maybe even a few, but if you haven’t journeyed through this album form start to finish then do yourself a favour – take a seat, turn up the volume, ease the treble and experience the master at work.</p></div></section><!--END VARIABLE SECTION--><section><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12 mt10 snapshots"><header><span>Previous - Live at the Gaslight</span></header><div class="row row-margin-0 pl5 pr5 pt10 box-content"><div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-6 pl5 pr5 item"><a href="http://www.facebook.com"><img src="assets/img/ernestellis.jpg" class="img-responsive"></a><h1>Guest Performance</h1><h2>Ernest Ellis performing Bob Dylan's 'Boots of Spanish Leather'</h2><h3>27th November 2014</h3></div><div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-6 pl5 pr5 item"><img src="assets/img/jack.jpg" class="img-responsive"><h1>Guest Performance</h1><h2>Jack Ladder performing Blind Willie McTell's 'How About You'</h2><h3>13th November 2014</h3></div></div><button class="center-block readMore_btn">All Live At The Gaslight Tracks</button></div></div></section><section><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12 mt10 snapshots"><header><span>Related Content</span></header><div class="row row-margin-0 pl5 pr5 pt10 box-content"><div class="col-sm-3 col-xs-6 pl5 pr5 item"><img src="assets/img/jack-ladder-sq.jpg" class="img-responsive"><h1>Guest Interview</h1><h2>Interview with Jack Ladder</h2><h3>20th September 2014</h3></div><div class="col-sm-3 col-xs-6 pl5 pr5 item"><img src="assets/img/blind-willie-mctell.jpg" class="img-responsive"><h1>Album Review</h1><h2>Blind Willie McTell</h2><h2 class="secondary">Last Session</h2><h3>27th August 2014</h3><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><aside><div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12 removePaddingRight removePaddingXS mt10"><section><div class="side-ad"><a href="http://jackladder.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/hurstville.gif" class="center-block img-responsive"></a></div></section><section><button class="center-block readMore_btn backToTop_btn mt10 scrollToTop" style="text-align:center">BACK TO TOP</button></section></div></aside></div></div></div></main><footer-nav></footer-nav></div><script src="assets/js/vendor/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/vendor/jquery.easing.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/custom.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/counter.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/vendor/owl.carousel.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/vendor/angular.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/app.js"></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=n,e[n]||(e[n]=function(){(e[n].q=e[n].q||[]).push(arguments)}),e[n].l=+new Date,c=t.createElement(a),o=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],c.src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",o.parentNode.insertBefore(c,o)}(window,document,"script","ga"),ga("create","UA-XXXXX-X"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
